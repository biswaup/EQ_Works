# EQ_Works
EQ_Task1 consists of task 1. 
It has been written in notebook format and in pandas and runs as a spark job. The word document Task_1_Explained.docx explains in details what I have done, conclusions and alternative approaches.

EQ_Task2 consists of task 2.
It uses a recursive function to calculate the job pipeline. It does not contain a main function. The pipeline function uses recursion and is just called where the end task and start task numbers are given as arguments. To test the method with different test cases, please just change the arguments in the last line where the pipeline function is called.
